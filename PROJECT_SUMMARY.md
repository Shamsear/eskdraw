# Tournament Spin Website - Project Summary

## What Has Been Built

A complete tournament player allocation system using dual spinning wheels for fair and exciting team roster creation.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- View all tournaments
- Create new tournaments with customizable pot counts
- Delete existing tournaments
- Quick access to tournament management

### 2. Tournament Management (`/admin/tournaments/[id]`)
- **Bulk Team Upload**: Add multiple teams at once (one name per line)
- **Bulk Player Upload**: Add multiple players to specific pots
- **Tab-based Interface**: Switch between Teams and Players views
- **Real-time Display**: See all added teams and players organized by pots
- **Validation**: Ensures all pots have players before allowing spin to start

### 3. Spinning Interface (`/admin/tournaments/[id]/spin`)
- **Dual Wheel System**:
  - Left wheel: Teams that still need players
  - Right wheel: Available players (filtered by pot availability)
- **Smart Filtering**: When a team is selected, only shows players from pots the team hasn't used
- **Animated Spins**: Smooth 4-second animation with easing
- **Progress Bar**: Visual tracking of allocation completion
- **Step-by-step Process**:
  1. Spin for a team
  2. Spin for a player
  3. Confirm allocation
  4. Repeat until complete

### 4. Results Page (`/admin/tournaments/[id]/results`)
- Grid display of all teams and their allocated players
- Players grouped by pot within each team
- Print functionality
- Completion status indicator

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
```
Tournament (1) ─→ (N) Team
Tournament (1) ─→ (N) Pot
Pot (1) ─→ (N) Player
Team + Pot (1) ─→ (1) Allocation ←─ (1) Player
```

### Key Constraints
- Each team can only get ONE player from each pot (enforced by unique constraint)
- Each player can only be allocated to ONE team
- Allocations track which pot the player came from

### API Endpoints Created

1. **Tournament Management**
   - `POST /api/tournaments` - Create tournament
   - `GET /api/tournaments` - List all
   - `GET /api/tournaments/[id]` - Get details
   - `PATCH /api/tournaments/[id]` - Update status
   - `DELETE /api/tournaments/[id]` - Delete tournament

2. **Team Management**
   - `POST /api/tournaments/[id]/teams` - Bulk add teams
   - `GET /api/tournaments/[id]/teams` - Get all teams

3. **Player Management**
   - `POST /api/tournaments/[id]/players` - Bulk add players to pot

4. **Spin Logic**
   - `GET /api/tournaments/[id]/spin` - Get available teams/players
   - `POST /api/tournaments/[id]/spin` - Create allocation

### Frontend Components

1. **SpinWheel Component** (`components/SpinWheel.tsx`)
   - Canvas-based wheel rendering
   - Dynamic color schemes for teams vs players
   - Smooth rotation animation
   - Randomized selection with visual feedback

2. **Admin Pages**
   - Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
   - Responsive design
   - Real-time state updates
   - Form validation

## How It Works

### The Spinning Process

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Admin creates tournament with N pots
   - Admin adds teams (e.g., 30 teams)
   - Admin adds equal number of players to each pot (e.g., 30 players per pot)

2. **Spinning Phase**
   - System identifies teams that still need players
   - User clicks "Spin Team" → random team selected
   - System filters players to only show available pots for that team
   - User clicks "Spin Player" → random player from available pots selected
   - User confirms allocation
   - System records allocation and updates availability
   - Repeat until all teams have players from all pots

3. **Completion**
   - When all allocations complete (Teams × Pots), tournament marked as "completed"
   - User redirected to results page

### Smart Filtering Example

**Scenario**: 4 teams, 3 pots (A, B, C) with 4 players each

1. **First Spin**: Team 1 selected → All 12 players available → Player from Pot A allocated
2. **Second Spin**: Team 1 selected again → Only 8 players shown (Pot B & C) → Player from Pot B allocated
3. **Third Spin**: Team 1 selected again → Only 4 players shown (Pot C) → Player from Pot C allocated
4. **Fourth Spin**: Team 1 completed → Only Teams 2, 3, 4 appear in team wheel

This ensures fair distribution and prevents duplicates.

## Files Created
